## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I didn't get a lot accomplished in the last week due to exams and midterms. Then over 
the weekend it was family weekend so I spent time with my family instead of doing hw. 
Although this week monday and tuesday Cory, Jarod, and I worked on setting up the data 
pipeline getting end of day data into the database. We created our own Postgres server
to work on as to avoid messing with the remote server.
 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week we aim to continue to get more data into the SQL local server and start designing and 
implementing the server schema. 

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Personal blockers in the last week were as previously stated I had my family visit so I was unable 
to get work done in most of my classes. In terms of technical blockers I need a better understanding 
of working with databases. I understand the Postgress syntax at this point its just a matter of 
actually working with a database. Another blocker is there are many people working on different tasks
for this project and I feel we need to better communicate how our parts are going to come together. 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

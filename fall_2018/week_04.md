## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Continued reading about the data pipeline code for end of day data. I also started looking at 
pytest and started to plan on tests Cory's code for end of day data.
 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Continue to learn about data pipeline to better understand what Cory is doing so I can write better
tests for the end of day data. Also this week I intend to get some more data pushed to the database 
and continue to discuss with Ranjit and Jarod how we want to structure the database. 

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

One blocker I had this week is I don't have much knowledge on data pipelines so I need to continue
learning and reading about this. Another blocker was we were unable to have a group meeting with our
off campus coordinator so that made it difficult to coordinate tasks for this week.  

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

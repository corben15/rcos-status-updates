## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I just went to bonus session on Nov. 7, 2018 where Justin Carlson gave a tech talk 
on google firebase. I am new to open source andplatform development so this was pretty
interesting to see web application development platform that is designed to be easy to 
use and handle all your needs. Hedgehogs, the project I'm working on, is well under way 
so obviously we won't be using google firebase but I'm definitely interested in learning 
more about google firebase. Slightly unrelated to RCOS but my undergrad research at RPI is 
designing an application to control a polymer fabrication. The app currently is not up 
and running and has a lot of trouble. Its in its beginning stages so I might try working 
with firbase to implement this. 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I wanted to go to most of the tech talks because I want to get the most out of this class and 
learn more about open source and IOT in general. After Wednesdays talk I am going to try my best 
to make it to another one. 


> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

 Again this week I felt a blocker was a lack of communication. But I do feel I am learning a lot
 about databases and hope to learn more about the data pipeline. Another blocker is I haven't 
 been able to test the front end testing yet because the project isn't done yet or ready to be tested. 
 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

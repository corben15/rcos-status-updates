## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I don't know what happened to my previous status update. I'm pretty new to using git and one of 
my status updates got deleted. I dont remember everything that was in the status update but in 
the status update I spoke about how I went to the bonus session where Justin Carlson gave a talk 
on google firebase. I found it very interesting because he showed how it allows you to extremely 
rapidly design an app that can have a database that is production quality. 

He also spoke about NoSQL databases which is what google firebase uses and this was something I 
hadn't heard about yet. So intend on doing some extra research on this. I'm not sure if it is
important for me to know for hedgehogs but I feel the more I learn the more I will get out of this 
class. 

This week I started research into pytest and unit testing in general. 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week I plan on continuing to read and learn about unit testing specifically in pytest. Since 
I know python already it seems pretty straight forward in the examples I have been looking at. 
So far the examples all seem to be just using assert statements to make sure the returned values 
of functions match the expected values. 


> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

 I'm a little unsure how I am supposed to test the code that has been written so far. The functions
 and code for the hedgehogs platform isn't as clear cut the code examples in the tutorial so it 
 is a little hard to know what  I'm supposed to be testing.  

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

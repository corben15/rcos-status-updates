## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Last week I got my environment and docker set file set up. Then I decided on what tasks I
would take on. I am going to be working on the data pipeline and the database.   

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I have little experience with postgreSQL and data bases so it is going to be a steep learning curve in order be able to progress when individual weekly assignments are given.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I started making a sample database on my laptop as a local server. I became more 
familiar with making databases. Then I accessed the database that is currently implemented 
using Postgres's online UI and also practiced accessing it through the terminal. 
 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

At the moment we have end of day data pushed to the database but we dont have an actual schema 
or layout. So this week I plan on discussing with Ranjit, our off-campus group leader, the actual
layout we should make in the database. And then implement this format instead of the scattered 
set of tables we have right now. 


> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

 Again this week I felt a blocker was a lack of communication. But I do feel I am learning a lot
 about databases and hope to learn more about the data pipeline. Another blocker is I haven't 
 been able to test the front end testing yet because the project isn't done yet or ready to be tested. 
 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

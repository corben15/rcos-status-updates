## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

In the past week I finished creating the new tables and adding them to the database. I only created 
three tables and each table had up to 7 or 8 rows. I still don't have as deep of an understanding of 
databases as I would like. This semester I looked up the course outline for Database Systems at RPI
to give me some guidance as to what I needed to learn to make a contribution to our project and 
read chapters 1-3 to get a better understanding of how databases work. I definitely learned a lot this 
semester about databases and there importance in platform development. I also looked at an online tutorial 
for postgres. Next semester I intend take Database Systems to further my understanding of databases. 

Here is the link to one of the tutorials I took:

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

The other part of this project I was assigned to work on was the pytests. So this week I plan to 
begin looking at the pytest library and seeing how Unit testing can be applied using this library.
In the recent weeks we just finished the database and some of the front end so this week after 
learning pytest I hope to get some unit testing done on the data collected. 



> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Some blockers I've had this semester in general is I have had little experience with platform 
developement. As a CSE I think I think I should have joined a project more hardware based because
I feel I could have been more help but this was definitely a good learning experience and an eye
opener on things I should learn.  
 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I just was thinking it is good that RCOS is broken into a 2000 level and a 4000 level as I have little 
experience in a lot of the areas for the project I was working on. I definitely think RCOS should 
include more tech talks because I found them very interesting and informative. I also think for people 
that are completely new to app and platform development there should be talks on general app development
to give students a better grasp on everything that goes into app design.

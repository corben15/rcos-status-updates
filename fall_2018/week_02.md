## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

As I stated last week I am going to be working on the data pipeline and the database. We are going to be making these in Postgres SQL so I spent the last week largely learning Postgres SQL. Also met with Ranjit to make more specific tasks to break the data pipeline and database into because those aren't very specific.   

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I am going to hopefully finish getting a good understanding of Postgres. So far I have been finding the syntax very simple. After I feel I have sufficient understanding I am going to begin making the Postgres table schema. 

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

One blocker is I feel I'm not fully sure about what my tasks are because the initial tickets we were assigned to were so vague. But through communication with the off campus coordinator we hopefully will be able to make more specific tasks. 

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
